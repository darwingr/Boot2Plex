GOAL

Be able to run Plex Media Server.app as a system startup item on a multiuser machine, without the requirement of the user running the server to have automatic login enabled.

Assumptions

Service run as user “_plex”. Original project had this user’s home directory in “/usr/local/plex”,  using Plex Media Server.app 'v0.9.11.4'.
This is expected to change.

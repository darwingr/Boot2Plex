This is a tutorial to make atv 2 tethered or untethered or non jailbroken atv3 work with plex media center via plexconnect. I was having issues with my atv2 contantly resetting while watching content on plex every few days. My apple tv is running an untethered jailbreak on 5.2 but from what I understand this should work on other firmware as well only 5.x and up since it needs the trailers app to function. This is also a tutorial for pms for mac only I do not own a pc so I personally cannot answer any questions on that topic but im sure its possible as well. I am not resposible if you brick your device, this how to is for informational purposes only. I have tested on two devices with no issues whatsoever use at your own risk! Ok now that thats over to the good stuff This has also solved the "memory leak issues that have plagued the atv2 untethered 5.2 seasonpass jb" I have yet to see a warning low memory since I have gone this route as stated on the main wiki page:

Install the cert to your apple tv from here:

https://langui.sh/2013/08/27/appletv-ssl-plexconnect/

Delete plex client on your appletv if its installed, if you have atv flash black this should be a breeze for you. Otherwise google is your friend search for your answer!

Download plexconnect on your mac from here:

https://github.com/iBaa/PlexConnect

Unzip, rename the folder to plexconnect and place the unzipped folder in your /users/YOURUSERNAMEHERE directory

Now to the autostarting plexconnect via launchctl

Next, create com.plex.plexconnect.plist with the following:

https://gist.github.com/chrishulbert/5772931

Edit this file, changing the *two* instances of 'Users/chris/PlexConnect' to the correct folder that you've installed PlexConnect in.

Go into the terminal, change directory into your folder, and enter the following commands (If you have loaded my plist before this it will not load plexconnect properly you must load this plist first):

Sudo su
cd /(yourfilelocation)
cp com.plex.plexconnect.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons/
Chmod 644 com.plex.plexconnect.plist
chown root:wheel com.plex.plexconnect.plist
launchctl load com.plex.plexconnect.plist
Launch start com.plex.plexconnect

plex media server plist made by me :P (requires com.plex.plexconnect.plist loaded via launchctl & modified plexconnect.py installed in your plex connect folder) This will run plex after you login not at boot since at this time plex cannot start at boot since it was coded that way. This will keep plex running even if it crashes and if the plex media center app ever coded differently it will load plex prior to login.

Copy your plex app and rename it to PMS in /applications then Show package contents of your new app PMS and rename Applications/PMS.app/Contents/MacOS/Plex Media Server to PMS

Open terminal then enter these commands
sudo su
cd /(yourfilelocation)
cp com.plex.pms.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons/
chown root:wheel com.plex.pms.plist
chmod 644 com.plex.pms.plist
launchctl load com.plex.pms.plist

I also added this to plexconnect.py above (import sys, time) at the beginning of the file so plexconnect can run after pms kills itself prior to login.

import time
time.sleep(1)

9. You will obviously need to change the plist to the proper directories for the plist and the working directory if you use alternates. This also allows you to not edit plexgdm.py anymore.

Here is the link to the plist & the modified plexconnect.py:

https://github.com/wahlmanj/com.plex.pms.plist

Reset you mac then goto your atv and change your network to manual and dont change anything but your dns to point to your pms server for example my mac ip is 192.168.1.101

I have yet to see trailers unavaliable yet when my mac is running which is typically 24/7 using the above methods.

Enable trailers on your atv if its disabled in parental controls and enjoy plex via the trailers app based on python & java via plexconnect on your apple tv!

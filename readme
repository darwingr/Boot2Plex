Here is a simple plist for plex media server to keep it up and running on osx. Prior to install change the __USERNAME__ string in the plist with your username. After you edit and copy the plist to /Library/LaunchDaemons open terminal then enter these commands:

sudo su
chmod +x install.bash
./install.bash

If you need to unload the plist for any reason open terminal then enter these commands:

sudo su
cd /Library/LaunchDaemons
launchctl unload com.plex.pms.plist

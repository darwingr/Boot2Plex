GOAL
Be able to run plex media server on Mac OS X from system startup as an unpriviledged user.

Primarily avoids need to run as login item on personal account with autologin,
while accomodating power loss.

How I am Using This:
Make a service user-account using the script I have in my other repo [ServiceAccountMaker](https://github.com/darwingr/ServiceAccountMaker).
enter `$ sudo .mk_service_user.sh plex`
Currently looks for the pms.app is in /Applications

IMPORTANT
The project still needs a bit of work and in fact FAILS to load on system startup.
This is due to the plex menubar item needing the "WindowServer" to be reachable,
which requires a user to be logged via gui in locally.
My workaround to this is below, following the installation.


INSTALLATION

1. Change directory (in terminal) where you unzipped or cloned Boot2Plex-master

2. Run the script
chmod +x install.bash
sudo ./install.bash

Re-run anytime you make edits to the plist.

AFTER SYSTEM STARTUP (workaround):

1. Log in with any user to gui.

2.
